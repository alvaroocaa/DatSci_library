# DatSci

Personal project to create a Python library to automatize recurrent day-to-day tasks performed at work involving treatment of data. This library will be updated as new necessities are faced and recurrent tasks need to be performed. 

It has been though as a library that will execute functions from different data streams:
* Fetching data
* Processing it
* Analyzing
* Cleansing

If anyone wants to give it a try feel free, it is an open-source project and contact me any time or create a push-request if you would like to contribute.

As of day 11/12/2024 official release of version 0.1. Stable version but will be worked and updated very soon as this is just a test that the project is working but give it a few months until it really becomes useful.
